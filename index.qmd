## Introduction


- In **market segmentation** clustering can be used to find groups of similar customers, and visualization is vital for the interpretation of the results.
- With **interactive visualization** we can improve our understanding of how the identified clusters differ, but we can also update the solution based on our own knowledge and interests.
- This is related to how we manually define clusters from scratch in a **spin-and-brush** approach.


## lionfish conception

We want a tool that allows us to:

1. Visualize the partitions in combinations of features using tour methods, both grand tour and **manual tour**.
2. Interactively select points (brushing) to refine the cluster solution, **spin-and-brush**.
3. Link multiple displays to focus on particular clusters, and to better understand the clustering solution.
4. Update displays based on user selections such as feature selection or cluster selection, or re-scaling.


## Implementation

A graphical user interface has been implemented in the `R` package `lionfish`:

- `R` package to work with implementations of clustering algorithms, and with the `tourr` package to generate tour paths
- `python` interface to use `TKinter` and `matplotlib` for the GUI and the interactive graphics
- `matplotlib` enables fast rendering and interactivity for linked brushing and manual tours

## Running lionfish - minimal example

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(lionfish)
library(tourr)
# setting up python environment
init_env()
# saving a tour path
guided_tour_history <- save_history(data,
                                    tour_path =
                                    guided_tour(holes()))
# generating the displays
obj1 <- list(type="2d_tour", obj=guided_tour_history)
obj2 <- list(type="scatter", obj=c("x1", "x2"))
# launching the GUI
interactive_tour(data=data,
                 plot_objects=list(obj1, obj2),
                 feature_names=colnames(data))
```

## Example: Austrian Vacation Activities

- Survey by the Europ√§isches Tourismus Institut GmbH at the University of Trier, 2,961 adult tourists spending their winter holiday in Austria in the 1997/98 season
- 27 vacation activities were ranked between "totally important" and "not important" (4 levels)
- We work with binary values ("totally important" or not), see [Dolnicar S, Leisch F (2003)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0047287502239037) for details
- Start from k-means cluster solution with k=6, visual feature selection of 12 vacation activities that are different between the clusters

## Example: Risk Taking

- Survey of 563 Australian
- Six different types of risks: recreational, health, career, financial, social and safety
- Rated on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (very often)
- Observations were grouped using k-means clustering with k=5

## Summary

- The `lionfish` package was tailored to market segmentation analysis, but can also be used for other tasks
- The implementation is modular, new types of visualizations can easily be added to the package
- Integration of `R` and `python` seamless thanks to `reticulate`
- The package is on CRAN, an article describing the implementation and market segmentation analyses will appear in the Austrian Journal of Statistics
